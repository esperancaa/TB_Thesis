### Exploring Novel Targets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis through Machine Learning Methods

This project accompanies the Master’s dissertation “Exploring Novel Targets for Mycobacterium tuberculosis through Machine Learning Methods” (University of Minho, 2025).
It presents a computational framework for drug–target interaction (DTI) prediction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, combining both self-supervised and supervised learning models, namely the Barlow Twins architecture and the BCM-DTI model, to explore the potential of artificial intelligence in accelerating tuberculosis drug discovery.

The overall objective of this work is to integrate chemical and biological data to identify promising compound–protein interactions that may serve as candidates for new anti-tuberculosis therapies. To this end, the project constructs a unified pipeline that connects data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation within a reproducible structure.
